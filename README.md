# MajorLoo
Part of the SFU API Challenge 2017. This app finds the nearest washroom around you.
Achieved 4th place in the competition.

## Motivation
This app is part of the SFU API Challenge 2017. We had to utilize Google Map API to create an application.

## Installation
Simply run this code on Android Studio. It requires actual Android device or AVD.

## API REFERENCE
Map services were provided by [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en)

## TODO
* Add more washroom data. The app is currently limited to City of Vancouver's data.
* Clean up code.
